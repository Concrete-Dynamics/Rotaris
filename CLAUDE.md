# Rotaris-crw — clean-room rewrite

This repository is the **clean side** of a clean-room reimplementation. Everything here must be
traceable to approved behavioral specifications, approved architecture decisions, public technical
documentation, or approved design material.

## Hard boundary — applies to every agent and session working in this repository

Do **not** read, clone, fetch, search, or quote from any of the following, for any reason:

- `https://github.com/Concrete-Dynamics/Rotaris` or any mirror, fork, or package of it
- `D:\Development\Apps\Rotaris` (a local checkout of that project)
- `D:\Development\Apps\Rotaris-cleanroom-sealed\` (the sealed reference clone and raw analysis)
- any transcript, scratchpad, or report produced by an agent that read the above

If a task seems to require one of those sources, it does not. Raise the gap as an open question
against the relevant requirement instead. Convenience, speed, and implementation difficulty are
never valid reasons to cross the boundary.

## Approved inputs

- `docs/spec/` — approved behavioral requirements (`REQ-<DOMAIN>-<NNN>`)
- `docs/architecture/` — architecture and Architecture Decision Records
- `docs/clean-room/` — process, reference record, zone policy, provenance
- public library and platform documentation
- the approved Claude Design UX reference for information architecture and visual design
- sanitized black-box conformance feedback (observable differences only)

## Process state

Implementation has **not** been authorized. The Specification Gate and the mandatory Architecture
Gate must both be approved by the user before any production code is written. Architectural spikes
that do not implement product behavior are allowed before that point.

## Traceability

Implementation work cites the requirement IDs it satisfies. Commits that implement behavior
reference those IDs so requirement, decision, code, and test remain linked.
