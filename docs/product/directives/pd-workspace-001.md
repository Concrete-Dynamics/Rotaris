### PD-WORKSPACE-001 — choosing the folder that is already open offers a new session

Where the folder chosen through the project-folder chooser of REQ-WORKSPACE-009 is one the requesting
window already has open, the choice SHALL NOT be left without observable effect. The product SHALL
raise a transient notice in the requesting window and in no other, stating that the folder is already
open and carrying exactly one action, labelled "Start a new session", which opens that window's own
start-session surface for the workspace it already has open.

The offer SHALL NOT be a modal dialog and SHALL NOT take keyboard focus from what the user was doing.
No main window SHALL be built and none SHALL be closed; the window's workspace, its active view, its
composer contents, its running runs and the last-opened-workspace preference SHALL all be left as
they were, whether the action is taken, the notice is dismissed, or it is ignored until it withdraws.
Whether the chosen folder is the one already open is decided by the rule REQ-STARTUP-163 fixes, which
this directive cites rather than restating.

**Why, and what it costs.** REQ-WORKSPACE-010's silent no-op is the right answer to a user who picked
the wrong folder by accident. It is the wrong answer to the user who deliberately re-picks the folder
they are already working in, because that gesture carries a legible intent — a second place to work
in this project — and the product's answer to that intent is a second session, which it already
builds. A no-op discards the intent and, to the person who made it, is indistinguishable from the
chooser having failed. The cost is that a chooser can now end in something on screen, so a reader of
REQ-SHELL-021's "a decline shows no folder chooser and changes no window" must not mistake this
notice for a change to a window; and a notice was chosen over a dialog deliberately, because someone
who re-picked their own folder should not be interrupted more heavily than the no-op this replaces.
