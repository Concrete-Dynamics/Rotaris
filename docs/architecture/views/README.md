# Architecture views — the system as built

Six perspectives on the codebase as it stands, drawn from the code and kept in step with it. `codebase.md`
is the *map* (where work lands, what stands in, what is owed); the ADRs are the *decisions*; these views are
the *picture* — what exists, how it is cut, how it runs, and where an addition lands.

| View | Question it answers | File |
|---|---|---|
| Component | What are the parts and which may depend on which? | [`01-component-view.md`](01-component-view.md) |
| Process | What runs in which OS process, and what crosses each boundary? | [`02-process-view.md`](02-process-view.md) |
| Runtime | What happens, in order, when a run starts, executes, is controlled and ends? | [`03-runtime-view.md`](03-runtime-view.md) |
| Seams | To add one of the things this product adds most often — which files, in what order? | [`04-seams.md`](04-seams.md) |
| State ownership | Which process owns a fact, where does it live, and who may write it? | [`05-state-ownership.md`](05-state-ownership.md) |
| Sequences | Startup, an approval, the board — the flows the runtime view does not own | [`06-sequences.md`](06-sequences.md) |

## Start here — what you are about to change

| You are about to | Read |
|---|---|
| add a command, a channel, a store column, a tool, a configuration key, a notice or a preference | [`04-seams.md`](04-seams.md) — the ordered edit path, then the view it names |
| add a package, or an import that crosses one | [`01-component-view.md`](01-component-view.md) — the allowed-edge matrix is the lint rule verbatim |
| change what crosses a process boundary | [`02-process-view.md`](02-process-view.md) |
| change the run loop, a turn, the controls or teardown | [`03-runtime-view.md`](03-runtime-view.md) |
| decide where a piece of state belongs | [`05-state-ownership.md`](05-state-ownership.md) |
| change startup, the approval round trip or the requirements board | [`06-sequences.md`](06-sequences.md) |
| draw, redraw or restyle a surface | [`04-seams.md` §8](04-seams.md#8-a-drawn-surface), then `docs/design/README.md` §7 |
| find the evidence that re-verifies an area | `AGENTS.md` — the proof-script index |

Each view carries its own section router at the top, so consulting one is a page rather than a chapter.

## Maintenance rule

These views are part of the record, not documentation written after the fact. Two obligations bind every
change to the code (stated in `CLAUDE.md`):

1. **Consult before modifying.** Before changing code, read the view that covers the area — the table above
   chooses it.
2. **Maintain after modifying.** When a change adds, removes or moves a package, an allowed edge, a process,
   a message kind, a channel, a command, a store table, a run-loop step, a control operation, a seam's edit
   path or the ownership of a fact, update the view **in the same commit**, and the "last reconciled" line
   below with it. A view that disagrees with the code is a defect of the change that made it so.

The diagrams are Mermaid; GitHub renders them. Names in the diagrams are the names in the code.

## Last reconciled with the code: **2026-09-16**

**The navigation pass.** Three views became six, and nothing about the system changed with it: `04-seams.md`
(the ordered edit path for the eight additions this product makes most often), `05-state-ownership.md`
(six homes, one writer each, consolidating facts that were already written down in three places) and
`06-sequences.md` (launch, the approval round trip, and the board's release → run → review → accept — the
three flows that cross every process and had no home). Each existing view gained a section router, and the
reconciliation chain moved to [`reconciliation-log.md`](reconciliation-log.md) so that "consult before
modifying" costs a page. **No package, edge, process, message kind, channel, command, window role, store
table, run-loop step or control operation moves**, because no code changed: this commit is documentation
only, and the three views that existed before it say exactly what they said.

Everything reconciled before this date is in [`reconciliation-log.md`](reconciliation-log.md), newest first.
